# Air Forces

Air forces are the primary aerial units in the game. Unlike Armies and Navies, air units fly in straight lines to **[airports](../cities/airports.md)** or cities and automatically engage targets upon arrival.

## Creation
- Every time you create an air force, you can give it a custom name.

- By default, you can have up to 8 air forces. 9th air force → costs 50 Gems; 10th air force → costs 100 Gems.

## Troops
To form a air force, you need to recruit troops.

- Each troop costs 30 **[Gold](../economy/gold.md)** to recruit.

- Troops can only be recruited inside your Air Force Base or an Airport.

## Aircraft
Air forces can be equipped with **[aircraft](../weapons/aircraft.md)**. The number of Aircraft equipped cannot exceed the number of troops in the Air force.

## Movement & Combat

- Air units fly directly between airports or cities.

- No attack cooldown applies to air forces.

- After successfully attacking an airport, you can occupy it.

- After attacking a city, air forces will immediately return to base.

- Once deployed, air forces cannot stop mid-flight, but they may return to the base or airport.

- To take off, the unit must be equipped with aircraft, and the number of troops must match the aircraft seats.

- Air forces cannot attack cities within alliance territory, but they can strike airports inside alliance territory.

- Airports cannot be targeted by Missiles, Armies, or Navies.

- When the Air Force is the attacking side, its oil consumption will greatly increase, and the defending side receives a +10% defense bonus.

## Combat Bonuses

- Air forces gain both Attack Boost and Defense Boost, each up to 100%.

- Defense Boost only resets when the unit is defeated.

- City **[fortifications](../cities/infrastructure.md#fortifications)** provide a +50% defense bonus against attacking air forces.

## Airport Support Defense (Auto-Interception)
When a city is attacked, the nearest airport that has your air forces stationed will automatically send them to intercept the attacker.

- Supporting air forces always engage the enemy first, before the city’s defenders.

- This works whether the attacker is an Army, Navy, or Air Force.

- Supporting air forces must be equipped and ready in the airport.

- Supporting air forces do not receive city defense bonuses, but they gain a 10% defense bonus when intercepting.

- If defeated, they will return to the base.
