Missiles are a long-range attack option in the game. Each missile has unique **[damage, range, and speed](../weapons/missiles.md)**.

- Missiles can only be launched from an Army Base. 

- A missile can attack multiple armies stationed in a single city.

- Missiles cannot target alliance capital and border cities.

- If you are unsure about the distance between your Army Base and the target, you can use the Survey tool.
