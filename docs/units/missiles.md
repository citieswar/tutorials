# Missiles

Missiles are a long-range attack option in the game. Each missile has unique **[damage, range, and speed](../weapons/missiles.md)**.

- Missiles can only be launched from your Army Base. 

- A missile can attack multiple **[armies](../units/armies.md)**/**[navies](../units/navies.md)** stationed in a single city.

- Missiles cannot target **[alliance capital](../alliances/capital.md)** and **[border](../alliances/territory.md)** cities.

- If you are unsure about the distance between your Army Base and the target, you can use the Survey tool.
