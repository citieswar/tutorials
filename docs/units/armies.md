# Armies

Armies serve as the primary ground forces for combat and are essential for city occupation. They can capture all types of cities across the map

## Creation
- Every time you create an army, you can give it a custom name.

- By default, you can have up to 8 armies. 9th army → costs 50 Gems; 10th army → costs 100 Gems.

## Troops
To form an army, you need to recruit troops.

- Each troop costs 30 Gold to recruit.

- Troops can only be recruited inside your Army base or a City.

- An army must have at least 10 troops to move.

## Weapons
You can equip **[weapons](../weapons/overview.md)** to your army. The number of weapons equipped cannot exceed the number of troops in the army.

## Movement
By default, armies can only travel by land **[routes](../cities/routes.md)** between connected cities.

However, if a Navy provides **[escort](../units/navies.md#escort)**, armies can also cross sea routes and reach cities overseas.
