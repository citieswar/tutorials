# Navies

Navies are the main forces for naval combat. They can only travel along sea **[routes](../cities/routes.md)** and are limited to capturing port cities.

## Creation
- Every time you create a navy, you can give it a custom name.

- By default, you can have up to 8 navies. 9th navy → costs 50 Gems; 10th navy → costs 100 Gems.

## Troops
To form a navy, you need to recruit troops.

- Each troop costs 30 **[Gold](../economy/gold.md)** to recruit.

- Troops can only be recruited inside your Navy base or a Port city.

## Warships
Navies can be equipped with **[warships](../weapons/ships.md)**. The number of warships equipped cannot exceed the number of troops in the navy.

## Escort
Navies have an Escort ability that allows Armies to cross ocean routes within the navy’s escort range.

- Escort distance depends on the combination of ships in the navy.

- The more diverse the navy’s fleet, the longer the escort distance.

- Escort range is displayed as a circle around the navy.

- You can click the Escort link to show your navy’s escort distance on the map.

- Armies inside the escort circle can move through ocean routes safely.

- A navy only provides escort when it is stationed in a city or in a naval base.
