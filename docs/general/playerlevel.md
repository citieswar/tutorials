## Lord
- When you reach level 20, you can designate one of your occupied cities as your Lord City.
- Once set, the city's civilian population and recruitable troops will be restored.
- All armies and navies stationed in the Lord City will receive a 100% base defense bonus.
- The Lord title will be displayed next to your player level icon.

## Lord Rules:
- Only cities you occupy can be designated as a Lord City.
- **[Alliance Capital](../alliances/capital.md)** cannot be designated as a Lord City.
- You can change your Lord City, but there is a 120-hour cooldown.
- If your Lord City is captured by another player, all Lord effects will be removed.
