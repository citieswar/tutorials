# Overview

Weapons are essential for **[combat](../wars/combat.md)**. You must equip your **[armies](../units/armies.md)**, **[navies](../units/navies.md)**, and **[air forces](../units/airforces.md)** with weapons in order to compete with other players and conquer cities.

## Types of Weapons
- **[Firearms & Artillery](../weapons/firearm.md)**
- **[Tanks](../weapons/tanks.md)**
- **[Ships](../weapons/ships.md)**
- **[Aircraft](../weapons/aircraft.md)**
- **[Missiles](../weapons/missiles.md)**


## Production
- Weapons are produced using **[resources](../economy/resources.md)** and **[gold](../economy/gold.md)**.
- Produced weapons are automatically stored in your weapon inventory.

## Repair
- Weapons damaged in battle are moved to the Repair Storage.
- Repairing a weapon costs half the resources and gold required to produce a new one.
