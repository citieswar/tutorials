# Combat System

Combat is resolved by comparing attacker and defender effective strengths.

## Simplified Formula
```
Effective Power = Sum(Unit Attack × Count) × Modifiers
```

## Modifiers
- Terrain bonuses
- City durability (new)
- Alliance defensive bonuses

### Example
Attacker: 1000 infantry (attack 15) → base 15000  
Defender: mixed units + city defenses → compare totals and apply modifiers.
