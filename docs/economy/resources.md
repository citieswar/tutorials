# Resources

The game features five types of resources: Oil, Steel, Food, Rare Earth, and Uranium.

The most direct way to obtain resources is through resource extraction. Open the Oil Well icon in the left sidebar, then click Discover to locate resources on the map. Each resource is extracted from cities.

If a city containing the resource is controlled by another player, you must pay a certain amount of Gold to the city owner in order to extract resources.

## Oil
Oil is a critical resource used to fuel military operations and equipment.

- **Consumption During March**: Armies equipped with **[tanks](../weapons/tanks.md)**, **[naval ships](../weapons/ships.md)**, or **[aircraft](../weapons/aircraft.md)** consume Oil when marching. The amount consumed is calculated based on the number of equipment and the distance traveled.
- **Missile Production**: Oil is also required for the manufacture of **[missiles](../weapons/missiles.md)**.
- **Stationed Troops**: When troops are stationed in a city, their equipment consumes Oil daily.
- **Insufficient Storage**: If your warehouse lacks enough Oil, stationed troops will leave the city and return to their base, causing the city to be lost.

## Steel
Steel is an essential resource required for the production of all weapons and missiles.

## Food
Food is a vital resource required for troop movement and maintenance.

- **Consumption During March**: Armies consume Food based on the number of troops and the distance traveled.
- **Stationed Troops**: When troops are stationed in a city, they consume Food daily. If your warehouse lacks sufficient Food, troops will leave the city and return to their base, similar to the effect of insufficient Oil.
- **Population Recovery**: Food can be used to restore a city’s population. Click on a city you occupy, then click Population to open the recovery dialog. You can track the number of people you have revived, and the Players Revived People ranking can be viewed under the Population tab in the trends menu.
- **Reward**: Reward – Players receive 100 Gems for every 1 million accumulated people revived.

## Rare Earth
Rare Earth is a crucial resource required for the production of high-end weapons and missiles.

## Uranium
Uranium is a critical resource required for the production of submarines and missiles.
