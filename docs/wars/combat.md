# Combat

Battles can only occur in **[cities](../cities/overview.md)** or **[airports](../cities/airports.md)**.

If the location is empty, you can occupy it directly without combat.

If the location is occupied, clicking Attack will trigger combat.

## Combat Rules
- Players in the same **[alliance](../alliances/overview.md)** cannot attack each other.
- Combat power is calculated based on both sides’ troops and **[weapons](../weapons/overview.md)**.
- **[Armies](../units/armies.md)**, **[navies](../units/navies.md)**, and **[air forces](../units/airforces.md)** have base **[attack and defense](../wars/combat.md#battle-damage-requirement-for-attackdefense-bonus)** experience, which can be improved through battles. (A **[Lord](../general/playerlevel.md#lord)** city can raise the base defense bonus up to 100%.)
- Attackers can increase combat power using Boosts.
- Defenders can gain bonuses from multiple sources:
	- City: Defense is increased through multiple sources:
		- **[Country](../wars/country.md)** bonus
		- **[Alliance Border](../alliances/territory.md)** / Dependency bonus
		- **[City Hall](../cities/infrastructure.md#city-hall)** bonus
		- **[Fortifications](../cities/infrastructure.md#fortifications)** bonus
		- **[City Durability](../cities/durability.md)** bonus
	- Airport: Can increase combat power using Boosts.

## Scout
- Before attacking an occupied city, you can scout to view its defense details, including:
	- City troops and weapons
	- Defense bonuses
-To scout a city, click the Scout button. Each scouting attempt costs 30 Battle Medals.

## Anti-Scout
- You can set an Anti-Scout to protect your cities from enemy scouts.
- To set an Anti-Scout, you need to spend Battle Medals:
	- Click the Cities tab in the top-right corner.
	- Select the duration of the Anti-Scout effect.
- You can set an Anti-Scout for 12 hours (5 medals), 24 hours (12 medals), 3 days (40 medals), or 7 days (100 medals).

## Battle Medals
- Awarded after each battle, based on the combat power consumed.
- Formula: 1 Battle Medal for every 10,000 combat power consumed.

## Monuments
Monuments commemorate major battles that occur in a city or airport (combat power > 500k attack/defense).

After winning an extraordinary battle, you can build a monument:

- Open the city Detail page.
- Click the Monuments tab.
- Press the Build button.
- Choose a valid location (must be in a measured area and not too close to another monument).
- Add your own inscription to the monument.

> Each Monument increases the city’s income by +50 Gold.
