# Country

Countries function similarly to **[alliance territory](../alliances/territory.md)** â€” you can define your Capital and Borders.

## Create Country
- Once you occupy more than 3 cities, you unlock the ability to edit your Country.
- Steps:
	- Click the Country tab in the top-right corner.
	- Select Edit Country.
	- Choose a city as your Capital.
	- Select at least 3 surrounding cities to form your borders. Make sure the Capital is located within your defined borders.
	- Click Save to finalize your Country.

## Benefits of establishing a Country
- Every day, you can receive 5 free Gems from your Country.
- All cities forming the Country receive a defense bonus.


## Country Defense Algorithm
- Country defense is determined by three main factors:
	- Value
	- Population (Surviving Civilians)
	- Area
- Maximizing these categories can increase the base defense bonus up to +24%.


## Capital Connectivity Bonus
- Cities in your country that are connected to the Capital (i.e., the shortest route contains no other alliance's cities) gain an additional defense boost.
- The more connected cities you have, the higher your total country defense, up to a maximum bonus of +40%.
