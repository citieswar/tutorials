# Dominion

 Dominion is a feature that allows players to expand their influence by capturing and managing territory.

## Dominion City
- A Dominion City is a city that you have actively claimed after occupying it.
- You need to spend 1,000 Gold to claim a Dominion City.
- Claimed cities remain yours even after your troops leave, until another player claims them.
- You can also revoke a Dominion City at any time. When you do, the 1,000 Gold you spent to claim it will be refunded.
- You can enable Auto Dominion. When active, every time you successfully occupy a city, it will be automatically claimed as a Dominion City.

## Create Dominion
- Once you have 5 or more Dominion Cities in a region, you are eligible to create a Dominion.
- Click the 'Dominion' tab next to 'Country' in the top-right. Then press the Edit button.
- On the map, select 3 or more occupied cities to form an enclosed area.
- Once your Dominion is established, it will appear on the world map and be visible to all players. Other players cannot attack or occupy cities within your Dominion territory.
- You can click the 'History' button to view the expansion history of your Dominion territory.

## Dominion Rewards
- You can receive daily resource rewards based on the number and quality of Enclosed Cities.
- If your Dominion is destroyed by an enemy, the reward timer resets.
- If you leave or lose your Dominion voluntarily, the reward timer pauses and resumes from the last reward time once a new Dominion is established.

## Notes
- A Dominion can be set within **[alliance territory](../alliances/territory.md)**, but it is not protected by the alliance.
- Dominion borders and alliance territory borders cannot overlap.
- Your Dominion cannot include alliance borders within its area.
- You cannot attack dominion borders with **[missiles](../units/missiles.md)**.
