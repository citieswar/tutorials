# City Infrastructure

## Monuments
Monuments are built to commemorate major battles that took place in a city. The victorious side can choose a location within the cityâ€™s measured area to **[construct](../wars/combat.md#monuments)** a Monument, leaving a lasting mark of their triumph.

## City Connectors
When a city has a measured area, you can build a Connector in it. Connectors link cities to each other and to your Army base, forming a connected network. 

Armies marching along these routes do not consume resources, making them vital for efficient expansion. 

Building requires 200 **[medals](../wars/combat.md#battle-medals)**. Each Connector has a usage limit of 20 marches before it expires.

## City Hall
The City Hall can be built in a measured city, providing a 20% bonus to defense and a 10% boost to gold income.

To construct it, you must first occupy the city and locate its true position within the urban area. 

Building requires 30 **[medals](../wars/combat.md#battle-medals)**, except when submitting the location for the first time, which will be reviewed by a moderator at no cost.

If the city is lost in battle, the City Hall is destroyed and must be rebuilt with another 30 medals.

## Fortifications
Fortifications can be built in a measured city, provide a 30% defense bonus against enemy **[armies](../units/armies.md)**/**[navies](../units/navies.md)** and a 50% defense bonus against enemy **[air forces](../units/airforces.md)**/**[missiles](../units/missiles.md)** for all stationed armies or navies.

Building requires 30 **[medals](../wars/combat.md#battle-medals)**.

If the city is captured, the Fortifications are destroyed. However, if you voluntarily leave the city, the Fortifications remain in place.
