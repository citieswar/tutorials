# Airports

Airports in the game are located at real-world airbase positions, and all airports are **[requested](../cities/request.md#airport-request)** by players. 

Your air force base must be established near an airport.

Airports can be occupied by air forces, but they cannot be attacked by armies, navies, or missiles. 

Airports are not connected by routes.
