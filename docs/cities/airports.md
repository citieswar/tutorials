# Airports

Airports in the game are located at real-world airbase positions, and all airports are **[requested](../cities/request.md#airport-request)** by players. 

Your air force base must be established near an airport.

Airports can be occupied by **[air forces](../units/airforces.md)**, but they cannot be attacked by **[armies](../units/armies.md)**, **[navies](../units/navies.md)**, or **[missiles](../units/missiles.md)**.

Airports are not connected by **[routes](../cities/routes.md)**.
