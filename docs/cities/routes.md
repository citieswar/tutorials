# Routes

All cities are connected by routes, which are **[drawn](../cities/request.md#route-request)** by players in the game.

There are 6 types of routes in the game: Open Terrain, Mountain, Desert, Forest, Tundra, and Ocean. Each route type affects the movement speed of your troops.

## Movement rules:
- **[Armies](../units/armies.md)** can move on the Open Terrain, Mountain, Desert, Forest, and Tundra routes.
- **[Navies](../units/navies.md)** can only move on Ocean routes.
- **[Air Forces](../units/airforces.md)** ignore terrain and move in a straight line between cities.

If your army/navy starts from the base or wild area, the starting point will be automatically connected to the nearest cityâ€™s route.

If your army or navy is defeated, it will return directly to the base.
