# Overview

Cities are the core of the game. Every conquest and expansion revolves around controlling cities. The formation of **[countries](../wars/country.md)**, **[dominions](../wars/dominion.md)**, alliance **[territories](../alliances/territory.md)**, and even the **[civilization](../wars/civilizations.md)** system—all are built on the foundation of cities.

## Basic Attributes
Each city has three fundamental attributes, and they are derived from real-world data. This ensures that every conquest reflects the true scale and importance of its real-world counterpart.

- **[Value](../cities/attributes.md#value)**: Represents the city’s overall competitiveness, based on real-world rankings of economic and strategic importance.
- **[Area](../cities/attributes.md#area)**: Corresponds to the city’s urban area in the real world.
- **[Population](../cities/attributes.md#population)**: Reflects the actual population data of the real-world city.

## Resource Attributes
Some cities also possess special resources, reflecting their real-world economic or strategic significance.

- **[Oil](../economy/resources.md#oil)**
- **[Steel](../economy/resources.md#steel)**
- **[Food](../economy/resources.md#food)**
- **[Rare Earth](../economy/resources.md#rare-earth)**
- **[Uranium](../economy/resources.md#uranium)**

Occupying a resource city increases your production rate for that specific **[resource](../economy/resources.md)**. Each occupied resource city grants a +10% production bonus to its corresponding resource type.
