## Value
Value represents a city’s overall competitiveness, based on real-world rankings of economic and strategic importance.

- **Player Ranking**: The higher the total value of the cities you control, the higher your personal ranking.
- **Alliance Ranking**: Alliances are ranked by the combined value of all the cities they own.
- **Top 100 Cities**: The number of Top 100 value cities you control determines your **[player level](../general/playerlevel.md)**.
- **Daily Rewards**: The higher your alliance’s total value, the greater the daily rewards it receives.
- **Country Defense**: The higher the value of cities within a **[country](../wars/country.md)**, the stronger the overall defense of that country.

## Area
Area corresponds to the city’s urban area in the real world.

- **Alliance Rewards**: The larger the combined area of cities an alliance controls, the higher its daily rewards.
- **Country Defense**: Cities with larger areas contribute to stronger overall defense for their country.
- **Player Contribution & Construction**: City area is measured based on player contributions. Only cities with measured area can build **[Monuments](../wars/combat.md#monuments)**, **[City Connectors](../cities/infrastructure.md#city-connectors)**, **[City Hall](../cities/infrastructure.md#city-hall)**, and **[Fortifications](../cities/infrastructure.md#fortifications)**.

## Population
Population reflects the actual population data of the real-world city.

- **Alliance Rewards**: The larger the population of cities an alliance controls, the higher its daily rewards.
- **Country Defense**: Cities with larger populations contribute to stronger overall defense for their country.
- **Population Composition**: A city’s population is divided into two parts: Civilian – Determines the city’s daily gold income. Recruitable – Determines how many troops can be recruited from the city.
- **Battle Losses**: If a city is involved in a battle, its population decreases according to the scale of the conflict.
- **Population Recovery**: Population can be restored by completing Civilizations tasks, lording the city, or contributing Food.
