# Overview

Welcome to Cities War, a multiplayer online strategy game built on Google Maps.  
In this world, real cities become the battleground. With over 11,000 **[cities](cities/overview.md)** already available—and the number constantly growing—you’ll compete with players worldwide to conquer and control them.

## Key Features
- **Conquer Real Cities**: Deploy your forces to capture cities across the globe, each with strategic value.
- **Build Your Army**: Assemble powerful land, sea, and air units to achieve dominance.
- **Form Alliances**: Join forces with other players to expand your borders and defend your territory.
- **Real-World Routes**: Move your armies along actual **[routes](cities/routes.md)** between cities, bringing a new layer of realism to strategic warfare.
- **Global Conquest**: Show your leadership and coordination as you fight for control of the entire world.

## Army Base
Conquest begins with your Army base. Its location is critical — placing it too close to a city is not allowed, but building it in a remote area will also limit your options.

- **Origin of [Armies](units/armies.md)**: All armies you create will originate from your Army base.
- **Defeat & Return**: When your forces are defeated, they automatically return to your Army base.
- **Missile Launch Point**: All missiles are launched from your Army base’s location.
- **Relocation**: You have one free chance to move your Army base. After that, moving it costs Gems and can only be done once every 12 hours.

## Naval Base
Before you can build a navy, you must first construct a Naval Base. Its location is limited—you can only place it near real-world port cities.

- **Origin of [Navies](units/navies.md)**: All naval units you create will originate from your Naval Base.
- **Defeat & Return**: When your fleet is defeated, it automatically returns to your Naval Base.
- **Relocation**: You have one free chance to move your Naval Base. After that, moving it costs Gems and can only be done once every 6 hours.

## Air Force Base
To build an air force, you must first construct an Air Force Base, which can only be placed near real-world airports.

- **Origin of [Air Forces](units/airforces.md)**: All air units are created from your Air Force Base.
- **Defeat & Return**: When your air forces are defeated, they automatically return to your Air Force Base.
- **Relocation**: One free relocation is allowed. After that, moving your Air Force Base costs Gems and can only be done once every 6 hours.
