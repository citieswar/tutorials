# Alliance Diplomacy

There are four diplomacy statuses between alliances: Allied, NAP, At War, and None.

Alliance leaders and co-leaders can set the diplomatic status.

All members can view diplomacy by clicking the Alliance Diplomacy → Show button.

When you move your troops, launch a missile, or use the radar, cities will be shown in different colors based on your alliance’s diplomacy status with others.

When your alliance sets another alliance to At War, your occupied cities will block the enemy’s armies/navies from marching through your **[routes](../cities/routes.md)**.
