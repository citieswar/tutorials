# Alliances

You can choose to play solo, join an existing alliance, or create your own alliance.

Being part of an alliance comes with benefits:

- All alliance members can receive daily rewards.
- You gain alliance protection: cities within the alliance territory cannot be attacked by other players.
- You can participate in alliance tournaments, such as **[regional wars](../alliances/regional.md)** and the **[Top 100 Cities](../alliances/top100.md)** Tournament, to earn large rewards.
- You can also participate in **[Rivalry](../alliances/rivalry.md)** to gain substantial rewards, including valuable resources and gold.
