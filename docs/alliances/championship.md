# Territory Championship

Territory Championship is a large-scale alliance competition focused on land control.
All alliances compete to occupy and hold as much territory as possible on the world map during the season.
The goal is to expand your alliance’s area, population, and value — and earn the highest score by maintaining control over your land.

## Schedule
