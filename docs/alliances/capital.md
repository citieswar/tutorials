# Alliance Capital

When your alliance has 5 or more members and has occupied 20 or more cities, the alliance leader can select a Capital City.

## Capital City
- The Capital City can station up to 5 armies from different members.
- Only members with the rank of Captain or above can see their alliance's Capital City.
- There is a 24-hour cooldown for changing the Capital City.

## Attacking Rules
- Only members of an alliance can attack another alliance’s Capital City.
- Only alliances that have established a Capital City can attack other alliance border cities.
- **[Country](../wars/country.md)** defense bonuses do not apply to Capital Cities.
- **[Missiles](../units/missiles.md)** cannot attack Capital Cities.
- No loot can be obtained from attacking a Capital City.

## Rewards for Attacking a Capital
- Your alliance gains **[Alliance XP](../alliances/level.md)** according to the enemy alliance’s value.
- The player who captures the Capital receives 100 Gems.
- Alliance XP is calculated as:
	 - If enemy alliance value < 3,000,000 → no XP or player gems.
	 - If enemy alliance value ≥ 3,000,000 → XP = enemy value ÷ 3,000,000, minimum 5 XP; player receives 100 Gems.

- When Alliance XP reaches certain thresholds, the alliance levels up, increasing the reward level.
