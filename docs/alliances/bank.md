# Alliance Bank

The Bank is a shared gold storage for the alliance. Every member can donate gold to the bank.

##Deposits
- All members can freely donate gold to the bank.

##Withdrawals
- If your withdrawal amount does not exceed your own donation total, you can withdraw anytime without approval.
- If your withdrawal amount exceeds your donation total, your request will enter a pending state and requires approval from the Leader or Co-leader.

##Withdrawal Allowance
- Each alliance has a withdrawal allowance setting.
- If a playerâ€™s withdrawal is within this allowance, no leader approval is required, even if it exceeds their donation total.
- Alliance leaders can set or edit the allowance amount via the Edit option.
