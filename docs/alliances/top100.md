# Top 100 Cities Conquest Tournament

Top 100 Cities Tournament is an alliance competition for control of the Top 100 value cities.

## Tournament Duration
- Each season lasts 120 hours and is held every 20 days.

## Scoring Rules  
- Only the cities occupied while being a member of the alliance will count toward the alliance’s score.  
- If a member leaves the alliance, the Top 100 cities they had occupied will still remain credited to the original alliance.  
- If the same member joins a new alliance, their previously occupied Top 100 cities will not transfer to the new alliance’s score.  

## Rewards
At the end of the season, the system will rank alliances based on the number of Top 100 cities they occupy.

- The top 5 alliances will receive gem rewards.
- All participants will receive resources and gold rewards.
- Rewards from the Top 100 Conquest Tournament will be merged with Rivalry rewards and stored in the Alliance Treasury.

> Note: The Top 100 cities are not protected by alliance territory.
