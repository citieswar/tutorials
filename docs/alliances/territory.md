# Alliance Territory

Once your alliance has a **[Capital City](../alliances/capital.md)**, the leader or co-leaders can set the alliance territories.

## Territory Rules
- Territories must include the Capital City and at least 5 border cities.
- You cannot set territories if there are other alliance cities already within them.

	- Can be attacked by **[missiles](../units/missiles.md)**.

- Unoccupied cities within the territory can be attacked.
- Border cities:

	- Receive a 25% defense bonus.
