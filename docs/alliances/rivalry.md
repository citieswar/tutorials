# Rivalry

A Rivalry is a small-scale war between two alliances, with two phases: Preparation (12h) and Battle (48h)

The alliance leader selects 5 members to participate. Once matched, both sides enter the 12-hour preparation phase.

After preparation, the system randomly selects 20 unoccupied cities as battle cities.

## Scoring
- A score is the total number of minutes you hold battle cities during the 48h battle phase.

## Rewards
- The winning alliance earns **[XP](../alliances/level.md)** and **[bank](../alliances/bank.md)** gold loot (10% of the defeated allianceâ€™s bank gold).
- All participants who earn a score receive bonus loot.
- All rewards are deposited into the Alliance Treasury.

## Rules
- Only participants can attack rivalry cities.
- Rivalry cities cannot be set as alliance **[capital](../alliances/capital.md)** or border.
- Rivalry cities do not have alliance **[territory](../alliances/territory.md)** protection.
- Participants cannot leave or be kicked from their alliance during the rivalry.
